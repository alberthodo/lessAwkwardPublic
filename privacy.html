        <h1>Less Awkward Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="meta"><strong>Effective date:</strong> November 22, 2025<br>
        <strong>Contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:78_mutter_ninths@icloud.com">78_mutter_ninths@icloud.com</a></p>
        
        <p>Less Awkward ("the App," "we," "us," or "our") helps people spark better conversations through curated question decks. We believe in privacy by design—your data stays on your device. This policy explains what minimal information we handle and how.</p>
        
        <h2>1. We Don't Collect Your Data</h2>
        
        <p><strong>Everything is stored locally on your device.</strong> Your favorites, question history, and app preferences never leave your iPhone or iPad. We don't track you, analyze your usage, or collect any personal information.</p>
        
        <h3>1.1 Optional Sign In with Apple</h3>
        <p>If you choose to sign in with Apple (optional feature), Apple provides us with a unique identifier to sync your favorites across your devices via iCloud. We don't receive your email address unless you explicitly choose to share it. You can use the app without signing in.</p>
        
        <h3>1.2 In-App Purchases</h3>
        <p>When you make a purchase, RevenueCat (our payment processor) and Apple process the transaction. We only receive confirmation that your purchase was successful—we don't have access to your payment information, which is handled entirely by Apple.</p>
        
        <h3>1.3 Support Communications</h3>
        <p>If you email us for support, we'll see your email address and message content. We use this only to help you and don't share it with third parties.</p>
        
        <h2>2. What We Don't Do</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>We don't collect analytics or usage data</li>
            <li>We don't track which questions you view or answer</li>
            <li>We don't use advertising or third-party trackers</li>
            <li>We don't collect device information, location, or contacts</li>
            <li>We don't sell, rent, or share your data with anyone</li>
            <li>We don't store your question answers or conversations</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>3. How We Use Minimal Information</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purchase verification:</strong> RevenueCat confirms your subscription status so we can unlock premium content</li>
            <li><strong>Support:</strong> We use your email only to respond to support requests</li>
            <li><strong>iCloud sync (if enabled):</strong> Your favorites sync across your devices using Apple's iCloud service</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>4. Data Storage & Security</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Local storage:</strong> All your app data (favorites, progress) is stored on your device using iOS's secure storage</li>
            <li><strong>iCloud (optional):</strong> If you sign in with Apple, favorites sync via iCloud, which is encrypted and managed by Apple</li>
            <li><strong>Deleting the app:</strong> Uninstalling the app removes all local data. There's no account to delete because we don't store accounts</li>
            <li><strong>Purchase data:</strong> RevenueCat stores purchase receipts for subscription management, which you can manage through Apple's subscription settings</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>5. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No account to delete:</strong> Since we don't collect data, there's no account to delete. Uninstall the app to remove all local data</li>
            <li><strong>Manage purchases:</strong> Cancel subscriptions anytime in Settings → [Your Name] → Subscriptions</li>
            <li><strong>Opt out of Sign in with Apple:</strong> You can revoke access in Settings → [Your Name] → Sign-In & Security → Apps Using Apple ID</li>
            <li><strong>Support emails:</strong> If you've emailed us and want your email deleted from our support records, email <a href="mailto:78_mutter_ninths@icloud.com">78_mutter_ninths@icloud.com</a></li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>6. Children</h2>
        <p>Less Awkward is not intended for users under 13. Since we don't collect data, there's no data to delete, but we recommend parental supervision for users under 13.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Apple:</strong> App Store, Sign in with Apple, and iCloud services are provided by Apple and subject to their privacy policies</li>
            <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> Handles in-app purchase processing and subscription management. Their privacy policy applies to purchase data they process</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this policy to reflect product, legal, or regulatory changes. We will post the updated policy in the app and on our website with a new effective date. Continued use of Less Awkward after changes means you accept the revised policy.</p>
